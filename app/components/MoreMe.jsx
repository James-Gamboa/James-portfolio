            <p>
              Since I entered the world of programming in 2021, I have been an avid learner. 
              I graduated as a &quot;Technician in web design and development&quot; at the Center for Technology and Visual Arts (CETAV).
              I took several courses on platforms such as Udemy, Frontend Masters, and FreeCodeCamp. I have applied my knowledge in projects such as a Pok&eacute;dex,
              a recreation of Coca-Cola&apos;s website, Audiophile, an e-commerce platform for audiophiles,
              and Travel Haven, an Airbnb clone. In addition, 
              I have collaborated in innovative projects such as &quot;Human Brush&quot;.
              My passion for programming and my commitment to excellence continue to drive me to explore new horizons and challenges in this exciting field.
